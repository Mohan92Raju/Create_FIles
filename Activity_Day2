               #first to create a demo.txt file i use touch command
touch demo.txt
               #now demo.txt file has been created, now i'll check the default given permissions of this file by using ls -lart command and argument.
ls -lart
               # there i found the given permissions are owner-rw , group-rw and anyuser-r by default.. to change it to owner-rwx, group-rw and anyuser-r ,
              # i use chmod command. by considering octet values of read-4, write-2 & execute-1 
chmod 764 demo.txt
              # now the file permissions are changed to owner - r/w/x, group - r/w, and anyuser - r. to confirm it i'll print the list of files.
ls -lart.
              # Done.
